This model would help and assist the drivers to gauge the kind of conditions that can help them avoid situations in order to avoid such accidents.\n\n# Data: \nThe data we are using is recorded by Traffic Records division and the information comes from Seattle Police Department that contains data of accidents that happened in the city from the period of 2004 to May,2020. The data that is contained within a csv file is constituted of 37 attributes or features and 194673 rows that contain various samples, the information is labeled and covers road conditions, weather, fatality records etc. \n\nWe have the dependent our target variable as 'SEVERITYCODE' in the dataset which describes the degree of severity of the accident within the data. \nThe columns \u2018EXCEPTRSNCODE\u2019, \u2018PEDROWNOTGRNT\u2019, \u2018EXCEPTRSNDESC\u2019, \u2018INATTENTIONIND\u2019 and \u2018INTKEY\u2019 have more than 50% of missing or null values hence we're gonna drop them from the dataframe. \nWe will extract only the attributes we are using to calculate the severity of an accident like 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND' and COLLISIONTYPE and build our model based on those attributes.
